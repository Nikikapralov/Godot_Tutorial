Godot Tutorial:

WHAT IS VISIBLE TO THE PLAYER:
The blue rectangle is everything that the player sees. You cannot make it bigger,
you can only zoom inside of it.

SCENES:
A Scene is something very important for Godot. A game is made up of several scenes that
are triggered to appear or do something in an event. Scenes are basically modules.

NODES:
Nodes are basically classes. They can have parents and children and inheritance is fully
implemented. There is an extensive list of preconfigured nodes one can use. Nodes are 
representations of ingame entities and their behaviour.

SCENE INSIDE A SCENE:
We can import a scene into another scene. That allows us to develop a game using different
scenes (modules) and then connect them together.
